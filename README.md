#NiceToHave
Authentication for User Rating and Search History!
Controller for Search History
Make search method in TitleController return a URL
All names for methods in Controllers should be same convention AKA "Post()/Get()/Delete()/Put()". Meaning no "GetAllUserRatings()".  
In Datalayer ensure if equating between strings use .Equals() and if equating between ints use ==
In WebAPI>Controllers for all Create/update methods return relevant object (has to be displayed with link).
Research if all parts of CRUD operations in Datalayer is required to use await and toAsync for the operation to be wholly async. 
If yes: All CRUD operations in Datalayer should be made into the async version of the operation.
SpawnDTO needs to overloaded to take single entities and lists of entities
Function find_similar_movies() from database can return doublicates titles - Are done!
